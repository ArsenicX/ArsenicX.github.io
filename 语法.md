## 虚拟语气
首先，如果说的是常识或者真理，则主句从句都是一般现在时。
If water is boiled to 100 degrees in CN, it becomes vapor.



其次，和「主将从现」区分开 如果我们想要说明的事情是有可能发生的事情，那就用「主将从现」，否则用「虚拟语气」

比如：
如果想说：”等他回来我就告诉他那个消息” ，可以用”I will tell him the news when he comes back.”  因为很明显我的意思是他有可能会回来，如果他回来我就告诉他那个消息。有可能发生，所以用主将从现

如果想说：“他那时候如果回来的话我就告诉他那个消息了”，这时候应该用”I would tell him the news if he came back.” 因为很明显我的话中暗示着“他那时候并没有回来”，所以我说的“他那时候如果回来”很明显是与事实相反的，所以用虚拟语气 

注意，这里的「主将从现」并不代表一定是将来时和现在是，只是说明二者的相对关系
如果我们要说：“ 我妈妈昨天说‘如果我下次考试能拿100分，他就给我买新手机’ 。”。
首先因为这句话是有可能发生的，即我其实是有可能拿100分的，所以我们这里要用「主将从现」
但是因为我妈妈说这句话是发生在过去的，所以我们要用过去时，即：
My mom said she would buy me a new phone if I got 100 score in my next exam yesterday.
即把主将从现全部回退一个时间：主将从现 -> 主(将来过去)从(一般过去)：从句是V-ed，主句是would + V.


下面是虚拟语气的三种文法：

| |条件（从句）|	结果（主句）|
|-|-|-|
|现在| / were |would/should/could/might + do|
|过去|had + done|would/should/could/might have + done|
|将来(很少用)|V-ed / were <br>were to + do<br>should + do|would/should/could/might + do|
- 虚拟现在：lf I were you, I would marry him without any hesitation.
- 虚拟过去：If you had come yesterday, you would have met he.
- 虚拟将来：lf tomorrow were Sunday, i would go to see my grandma.
比较常见的是虚拟将来是“如果你有什么问题，请联系…”：If you should have any question, please contact …

### 几种特殊情况
1. 名词性从句
    1. 表示与现在事实相反的愿望：did / were
        - I wish I knew how to deal with such kind of thing.
    2. 表示将来的愿望：would / should / could / might + do
        - I wish he would try again.
    3. would rather引导的宾语从句：
        - I would rather you posted the letter right away.
        - I would rather died here
2. 如果是otherwise、but for 、without引导的虚拟语气
虚拟现在：would + do
虚拟过去：would(not) + have done.
    - But for your help，I might have failed（如果不是你的帮助，我可能会失败）
3. 提升逼格的虚拟语气：without ... would ...（如果没有... ，那将会...）

### 虚拟倒装：
将IF 省略，然后将主语和下面的三个关键词换位置
* 虚拟条件句中含有had
If he had come yesterday，he would have know it. = Had he come yesterday，he would have known it.
* 虚拟条件句中含有were
If I were there，I would help them. = Were I there，I would help them.
* 虚拟条件句中含有should
If I should have 2000,000 yuan, I would buy a good car. = Should I have 2000,000 yuan, I would buy a good car.

## 倒装句
如果原句的谓语动词没有主动词或情态东西，需要补充do、does、did

### 完全倒装
1. 把整个谓语提前
    - In came the teacher and the class began
2. there be
    - There is a cat
3. 由地点和时间副词引出
    - Under that tree sits a beautiful girl.

### 部分倒装
1. 由 only 引导：仅仅是把动词提前到了名词前面
    - only in this way will you make it
    - only then did i begin to like her
2. 由否定意义的词引导，比如never、hardly、little
    - Never before i have seen her
3. Not only ... but also ...、Not only ... But ... as well、No sooner ... that、hardly ... when
    - Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well
4. so + adj.
    - So sudden was the attack that we had no time to escape.
5. 祝愿
    - May you succeed. 祝你成功

### 虚拟语气倒装：见上

---
## 反义疑问句：前肯后否，前否后肯
注意，有些词虽然没有not，但是也表示否定。比如seldom、hardly
1. 在祈使句中，否定用won’t，肯定用will：
    - Open the door, won’t you? 打开门，不好吗？
    - Don’t open the door, will you？ 打开门，好吗？
2. 如果是let’s ，则不论肯定还是否定，都用shall we
    - Let‘s go outside, shall we?
    - Let‘s don’t go outside, shall we?
3. 如果是let us，则不论肯定还是否定，都用 will you
    - Let us go outside, will you?
    - Don’t let us go outside, will you?
4. 有must的情况，因为must有两种含义：必须；肯定（表推测）
表示“必须”时，反义疑问用mustn’t / needn’t
    - He must study hard, mustn’t he?
表示“肯定（推测）时”，反义疑问用must后面的动词的否定
    - You must be joking, aren’t you?
5. 从句通常的从句的反义疑问都是跟着主句走的
    - You must be joking, aren’t you?但是宾语从句的比较特殊，它和从句相关
    - i dont think he has got it, has he?（强调句）

---
## 名词性从句
- What he wants to tell us is not clear.
- It 's a good thing that you were insured.
但是注意和强调句区分：It is ... that/who ...
而区分要领就是，把上面的固定形式去掉之后，剩下的能不能凑成完整的一句话
- It is in the year 1995 that I was born

### 名词性从句作宾语
什么时候 that 可以省略：略

### 名词性从句作表语
引导宾从时，if 和 whether 可以互换
以下情况只能用whether，不能用if
1. 引导表语从句时
2. 引导同位语从句时（同位语：解释名词的句子）
3. 前面是介词时
4. 主语从句位于句首时
- I wanna know if they will pick us up
- The question is whether they will be able to help us

---
## 定语从句
This is the book(先行词) that(关系词) i'd love to read.
1. 从句充当宾语时可以省略关系词，充当主语定语时不行
2. 以下情况只能用which
    1. 关系词之前有介词
    2. 指物的时候引导非限定性定语从句 (去掉后也不影响主句意思的定语从句)
        - I have a car, which is a sport car.
3. 以下情况只能用that
    1. 前面有who、which等疑问词
        - Who is the man that is standing there?
    2. 先行词是人+物、人+动物
        - We talking about the car and Peter that is so funny.
    3. 先行词是，或者说被下列词语修饰时，只能用that
        - everything、anything...
        - any、every、the only...
        - 序数词
        - 比较级、最高级
4. 以下情况只能用who
    1. 先行词为 one、anyone、those
        - We were the ones who killed her,
    2. 先行词是人称代词
        - Only you who can save her
